# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) 

## 1. Introduction:
The business world has seen a major shift, with companies placing an increasing emphasis on their customers. In today’s competitive market, a customer-focused strategy has become the norm, driven by the abundance of choices available to consumers when choosing products or services.

As businesses compete by better meeting customer needs and expanding their market
presence, the value of growing and retaining their customer base becomes crucial.

However, like attracting new customers, keeping existing ones also involves significant expenses (such as discounts, personalized offers, etc.).

This leads to an important question: should businesses aim to retain every customer? Not necessarily. In every business, certain customers offer more value through their long-term loyalty, while others may only make a single purchase. Recognizing these different customer groups and concentrating on the high-value ones is critical for sustaining a position in today’s highly competitive environment.

The real challenge, however, is identifying which customers are the most valuable.

**What is Customer Value?**

Customer Value, often called Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), represents the total financial worth of all transactions a customer makes with your business during their entire relationship. "Lifetime" refers to the period a customer continues to purchase from your business before moving to a competitor.

## 2. Project Details

This project focuses on estimating Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using a dataset of online retail transactions. The dataset includes information on customer demographics, transaction history, and product details. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of customer behavior, identify high-value customers, and develop strategies to maximize CLV.
Furthermore, this project is divided into three parts:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Methodologies that are used to calculate and predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
